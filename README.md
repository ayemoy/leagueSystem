# leagueSystem
I worked on this project for about 4 months.
In this project, I implemented a system for managing football leagues.
I started with a literature review, then designed and planned the system including Use Cases' architecture and  class diagram. I implemented a number of Use cases and built them unit tests, integration tests and acceptance tests.
I implemented the 3-layer model in this task:
1) SERVICE layer: The user interface with the application. From here, requests are sent to the DOMAIN layer, and tests are performed on the input.
2) DOMAIN layer: In this layer the functionality is implemented, and from here the user requests to access the database and check before entering the database.
3) DATABASE layer: All users and all information related to this system are stored here. I used a MYSQL database and in this layer new information is retrieved or put into the database, including tests.



Then, i compared the performance of different models like KNN, RANDOM FORREST, ANN  and used FOLD CROSS VALIDATION to perform HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION.
In the end of the project i presented the project with the attached file of presentation.
