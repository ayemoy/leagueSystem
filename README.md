# leagueSystem
I worked on this project for about 4 months.
In this project, I implemented a system for managing football leagues.
I started with a literature review, then designed and planned the system including Use Cases' architecture and  class diagram. I implemented a number of Use cases and built them unit tests, integration tests and acceptance tests.
Then, i compared the performance of different models like KNN, RANDOM FORREST, ANN  and used FOLD CROSS VALIDATION to perform HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION.
In the end of the project i presented the project with the attached file of presentation.
